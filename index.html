      <p class="intro">NEW YORK — Mayor Bill de Blasio declined to restore a full-time remote option at New York City public schools this fall, arguing that it would hamper the quality of education and cut students off from support systems. As the public school system welcomed back its nearly one million students this month, de Blasio has said that vaccinations, mask requirements, coronavirus tests and other measures would allow students and staff to attend classes in person. Here’s what you need to know about how the 1,800 public schools in the city plan to combat Covid-19 in classrooms.

         <p class="description"> As of early October, the school reopening plan requires that schools test 10% of unvaccinated students every week. The plan initially implemented by the de Blasio administration called for schools to test unvaccinated students every other week, but was criticized by some as too infrequent. The schools can only test unvaccinated students whose parents return a consent form.

         <p class="description">Nearly 75% of children ages 12 and over have been fully vaccinated in New York City, according to the Education Department. While the vaccine is currently not available to children 11 years of age and younger, Pfizer requested authorization from the Food and Drug administration after it found in clinical trials that its shot is effective for children between 5 and 11 years old.</p>

         <p class="description">Some elementary students no longer have to quarantine after an individual at school tests positive for Covid-19, according to an overhaul of the policy announced by de Blasio last week. Students originally had to quarantine for 10 days after exposure, but no longer do as long as both the infected individual and the exposed individual consistently wore masks when they were together.

         <p class="description">Middle and high school students who are exposed to a confirmed Covid-19 test have to quarantine without a remote learning option. But they can test out of it before the full 10 days if they submit a negative test on the 5th day of quarantine.
